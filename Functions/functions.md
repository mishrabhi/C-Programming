**FUNCTIONS**

* Functions are used to divide a large program into small pieces.

* A function can be called multiple times to provide reusability and modularity to a C program.

* Also called procedure or subroutine.

* Basic syntax of a C function:

    return_type function_name(data_type parameter1, data_type parameter2, ...){
        //code to be executed
    }




* A function is declared to tell a compiler about its existence.

* A function is defined to get some task done.

* A function is called in order to be used.



* In C programming lanuage we can call the function in two different ways- call by reference or call by value.We can see example of this in problems folder.
