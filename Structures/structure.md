* Structures are user defined data type in C.

* Using structures allows us to combine data of different types together.

* It is used to create a complex data type which contains diverse information.

* They are very similar to arrays but structure can store data of any type, which is practically more useful.

* Suppose we want to store information like Name, Address, Email, Employee ID of 500 employees working in an ABC Pvt company. Then for this purpose we use structures because their information contains multiple data types.
