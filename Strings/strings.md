**Strinds**

* Is string is a data type in C => NO

* String is not a supported data type in C but it is a very useful concept used to model real world entities like name, city, etc.

* We express strings using an array of characters terminated by a null character ('\0'). We need this null character to tell the compiler that the string ends here.
